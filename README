  Jactimer is  a gui countdown timer written in C++ using the Qt framework. 
  It uses the phonon backend to play an audio file or start a programm after 
  the countdown has finished. Window decorations are hidden by default to use
  up as little desktop space as possible. The system tray icon is animated to 
  indicate the timer's current progress.

    If you can't install these via your packet manager, you're out of luck.
    You'll need to get the Qt-SDK from http://qt.nokia.com/.
  
  Build-dependencies:
  --------------------
    qt4-qmake
    qt4-dev-tools
    libqt4-dev
    libqt4-phonon-dev
    (>= Qt 4.6.2)
    If you can't install these via your packet manager, you're out of luck.
    You'll need to get the Qt-SDK from http://qt.nokia.com/.
  
  Build from scratch in linux:
  -----------------------------
    1. Untar and gunzip the source archive:
        $ tar zxfv jactimer-1.0.tar.gz
    2. Change into the src/ folder:
        $ cd jactimer-1.0/src
    3. Run qmake:
        $ qmake
    4. Run make 
       (This will fail if build-dependencies - see above - are not met):
        $ make
    5. If all built without errors you now have the jactimer executable in the
       current directory:
        $ ls -lah jactimer
    6. Run jactimer:
        $ ./jactimer
      
  Optional:
  ----------
    7. If you want to install jactimer system wide, 
       copy the jactimer binary to /usr/bin:
        $ su cp jactimer /usr/bin
    8. If you are running a freedesktop.org compliant desktop environment like 
       Gnome you can copy the jactimer.desktop file to /usr/share/applications/
       (you'll have a neat entry in the launcher menu):
        $ su cp freedesktop/jactimer.desktop /usr/share/applications
    9. Install the jactimer icons:
        $ su cp freedesktop/jactimer.xpm /usr/share/pixmaps/
        $ su cp freedesktop/jactimer.png /usr/share/icons/hicolor/48x48/apps/
  
  Build in Win:
  --------------
    Dependencies (other from Qt): A recent Direct X version (>= 9)
    Install the Qt SDK (full) from http://qt.nokia.com/
    Run installed Qt-Creator and open the project file jactimer.pro.
    
    Run Build->Build All.
